# 🧠 Code. Conquer. Learn.

A personal blog website built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **ShadCN UI**, and **Acertainty UI** where I document my journey through **Data Structures & Algorithms**, **debugging**, **tech learnings**, and **project-building experiences**.

This is not a tutorial site — it’s a **developer diary** where I write about what I learned, how I debugged, and how I grew.

- 🚀 Built with Next.js 14 App Router
- 🎨 Styled using Tailwind CSS
- 🧩 Modular components using ShadCN UI & Acertainty UI
